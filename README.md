# 🌿 Deforestation Detection Using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses NDVI to detect deforestation using remote sensing data. The NDVI is calculated using simulated (dummy) Red and NIR band values to visualize vegetation health.

This project was developed as part of the *AICTE-Edunet Internship Program* under the topic of *AI/ML in Earth Observation*.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the use of satellite bands (Red and NIR) for vegetation analysis.
- Calculate NDVI using basic NumPy operations.
- Visualize NDVI results using Matplotlib.
- Create a color-coded vegetation map.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- *Python*
- *Google Colab*
- *NumPy*
- *Matplotlib*
- (Optional) Pandas, CSV (if you included NEO data)

---

## 📈 Methodology
1. *Created dummy Red and NIR band arrays*
2. *Calculated NDVI using the formula*  
   \[
   \text{NDVI} = \frac{NIR - RED}{NIR + RED}
   \]
3. *Visualized NDVI as a heatmap*
4. (Optional) Saved the output plot as PNG

---

## 🌍 Application
NDVI is widely used in:
- Monitoring deforestation
- Agricultural health analysis
- Land cover classification
- Climate and environmental change studies
